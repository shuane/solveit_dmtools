    "'**Dialog Helper for Polya\\'s Problem-Solving Method**\\n\\nThis module provides quick access to Polya\\'s four-stage problem-solving process\\nthrough interactive prompts.\\n\\nEach stage has multiple questions/prompts:\\n- To preview one you can just print it/type its name in a cell and hit Submit\\n  - e.g. `dhp.act.next` shows you \"(prompt) What is next?\".\\n- To execute one you call it by adding () after the name\\n  - e.g. `dhp.act.next()` will replace the current message cell with a prompt cell having \"What is next?\" in it\\n    - It will be automatically executed, you can hit Esc to stop it and/or Enter to edit the prompt\\n\\n**TYPICAL FLOW:**\\n- Start with `dhp.u` (`understand`) (even briefly) to clarify your understanding of the problem\\n- Move to `dhp.p` (`plan`) to develop initial strategies\\n- Switch between `plan` and `act` (or `a`, or `x`/`execute`) as you develop and test approaches\\n- Use `dhp.r` (`review`) to gain deeper understanding of your approach and findings\\n- You might loop back to other steps after `r` (`review`)\\n\\nIf you feel stuck, run `dhp.help()` and it will submit the prompt cell it creates - SolveIt will help you pick a next prompt!\\n\\n**UNDERSTAND STAGE - Clarify the problem before solving**\\n- dhp.u.summary() - Creates a prompt cell asking SolveIt to give a **concise summary** of the problem\\n- dhp.u.info() -

    "- The tool is meant to be run through a marimo app (for example via `uvx marimo run --sandbox …`), not just as a plain command-line script. A browser UI opens where you supply the blog URL and output filenames before clicking “Run!”.\n",
    "- It pulls the article text (using the context-extraction helper), asks Gemini 2.5 Pro to transform that text into a podcast-style script, then sends the script to OpenAI’s text-to-speech service to produce natural audio.\n",
    "- When finished, it saves both an MP3 and the generated script (`<output>_script.md`) in the working directory.\n",
    "- You need API keys for both OpenAI and Google Gemini, set via environment variables, and the project expects Python 3.12 (with a note that `pydub` currently doesn’t support 3.13).\n",
