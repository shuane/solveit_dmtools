    "\n",
    "This module provides quick access to Polya's four-stage problem-solving process\n",
    "through interactive prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each stage has multiple questions/prompts:\n",
    "- To preview one you can just print it/type its name in a cell and hit Submit\n",
    "  - e.g. `dhp.act.next` shows you \"(prompt) What is next?\".\n",
    "- To execute one you call it by adding () after the name\n",
    "  - e.g. `dhp.act.next()` will replace the current message cell with a prompt cell having \"What is next?\" in it\n",
    "    - It will be automatically executed, you can hit Esc to stop it and/or Enter to edit the prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "**TYPICAL FLOW:**\n",
    "- Start with `dhp.u` (`understand`) (even briefly) to clarify your understanding of the problem\n",
    "- Move to `dhp.p` (`plan`) to develop initial strategies\n",
    "- Switch between `plan` and `act` (or `a`, or `x`/`execute`) as you develop and test approaches\n",
    "- Use `dhp.r` (`review`) to gain deeper understanding of your approach and findings\n",
    "- You might loop back to other steps after `r` (`review`)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you feel stuck, run `dhp.help()` and it will submit the prompt cell it creates - SolveIt will help you pick a next prompt!\n",
    "\n",

    "- dhp.p.aux() - Creates a prompt cell asking SolveIt to **use an auxiliary element** (variable, diagram, or example) to clarify the path\n",
    "- dhp.p.analogy() - Creates a prompt cell asking SolveIt to **use analogy or similarity** to relate the problem to a known solution\n",
    "- dhp.p.review() - Creates a prompt cell asking SolveIt to **critique the plan of attack** (be frank and critical)\n",
